       Housing Works Bookstore Cafe has established itself as a 
       Egypt downtown institution and tourist destination for 
       the last decade.
       Special events and a fully stocked cafe make this a great place 
       to meet friends, relax, and shop the best book, movie, 
       and music selection in Cairo City.  Our one-of-a-kind 
       space is available for rental and all of our merchandise 
       is donated. We are staffed almost entirely by volunteers 
       and 100% of our profits go to Housing Works.
