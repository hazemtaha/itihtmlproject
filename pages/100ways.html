					Intrinsic motivation has been studied since the early 1970s.
					Intrinsic motivation is the self-desire to seek out new things and new challenges, to analyze one's capacity, to observe and to gain knowledge.
					It is driven by an interest or enjoyment in the task itself, and exists within the individual rather than relying on external pressures or a desire for reward.
					The phenomenon of intrinsic motivation was first acknowledged within experimental studies of animal behavior. 
					In these studies, it was evident that the organisms would engage in playful and curiosity driven behaviors in the absence of reward. 
					Intrinsic motivation is a natural motivational tendency and is a critical element in cognitive, social, and physical development.
					Students who are intrinsically motivated are more likely to engage in the task willingly as well as work to improve their skills, which will increase their capabilities.
